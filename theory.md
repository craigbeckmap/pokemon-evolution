## Ways to expand the working application

To expand the example into a working application, we can create a microservice
backend API that provides endpoints for retrieving the evolution chain of a Pokemon.
We can also create a simple frontend application that allows users to input a Pokemon
name and display its evolution chain.

## Backend API:
1. Use a Node.js server like Express.js to handle HTTP requests.
2. Implement an endpoint, such as /evolution-chain/:pokemonName, that accepts a Pokemon name as a parameter.
3. Inside the endpoint handler, call the getEvolutionChain function to retrieve the evolution chain for the given Pokemon.
4. Return the evolution chain as a JSON response.

## Frontend Application:
1. Create a user interface with an input field for the Pokemon name and a button to trigger the request.
2. Add an event listener to the button that retrieves the input value and makes an HTTP request to the backend API endpoint.
3. Display the evolution chain returned by the API in a user-friendly format.

## Considerations for Testing:
1. Unit tests: Write unit tests for the getEvolutionChain function and the buildTransformedData helper function using a testing framework like Jest. Test different scenarios, such as successful API responses and error handling.
2. Integration tests: Write integration tests to ensure that the backend API endpoints are functioning correctly. Use a testing framework like Supertest to make HTTP requests to the API and assert the expected responses.
3. UI tests: Use a UI testing framework like Cypress or Selenium to automate tests for the frontend application. Test user interactions, input validation, and the display of the evolution chain.

## Deployments and Releases:
1. Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
2. Use a containerisation tool like Docker to package the application into a container. This allows for easy deployment and scalability.
3. Deploy the application to a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Use infrastructure-as-code tools like AWS CloudFormation to define and manage the infrastructure resources.

## API Versioning and Management:
1. Consider using semantic versioning to manage API versions. Increment the major version for breaking changes, the minor version for backward-compatible additions, and the patch version for backward-compatible bug fixes.
2. Use a versioning scheme in the API endpoint URLs, such as /v1/evolution-chain/:pokemonName. This allows for multiple versions of the API to coexist and be accessed by different clients.
3. Implement versioning strategies like API version negotiation or URL versioning to handle different client requirements and gracefully transition between API versions.

## Non-Functional Requirements:
1. Performance: Optimize the application for performance by caching frequently accessed data, implementing pagination for large responses, and using efficient algorithms for data processing.
2. Scalability: Design the application to be horizontally scalable by using load balancers, auto-scaling groups, and distributed databases. Consider using serverless technologies for event-driven scaling.
3. Security: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data and restrict access to certain API endpoints. Use secure communication protocols like HTTPS and encrypt sensitive data at rest.
4. Monitoring and Logging: Set up monitoring and logging tools like App Dynamics to track application performance, detect errors, and troubleshoot issues.
5. Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and error messages to provide meaningful feedback to users and developers. Use appropriate HTTP status codes and error response formats.
6. Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation for the API, including endpoint descriptions, request/response examples, and usage guidelines. Consider using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI for API documentation.

By considering these aspects, we can create a robust and scalable application with a microservice architecture, automated testing, and efficient deployment processes.
